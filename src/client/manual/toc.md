# Playground

Playground is a simple device control and testing application. You can
connect to local hardware using either [Intiface
Desktop](https://intiface.com/desktop) or directly in your browser,
and control it locally.

While it is a feature that may be implemented in the future,
Playground does not currently provide online or remote control. All
control functionality is local.
